Problem: given a String containing an expression in postfix notation, determine the result.
For example, if the String is "5 2 + 11 3 - * 4 /", the result should be 14.
For simplicity, assume that there are spaces between all numbers and operators.

Solution: Use a stack of numbers.
- First, split the string up into tokens separated by whitespace.
  (You can use a Scanner for this; look for the Scanner constructor that takes a String.)
- Then, for each token:
    - If it is a number, push it onto the stack.
    - Otherwise, if it is a valid operator, pop two numbers off the stack,
      apply the operation to the two numbers, and push the result onto the stack.
      (If there aren't two elements to pop off the stack, the expression is not valid.)
    - Otherwise, the expression is not valid.
- At the end, the stack should contain exactly one number, which is the result. Otherwise,
  the expression is not valid.
