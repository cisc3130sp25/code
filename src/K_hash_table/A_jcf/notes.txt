interface Set<E> extends Collection<E>
    A Set is a Collection that does not permit any
    duplicate elements.
    The add(e) method doesn't add e, and returns false,
    if e is already in the set.
    Otherwise, the methods are like those of the Collection interface.

class HashSet<E> implements Set<E>
    This is the basic implementation of Set.
    It uses a "hash table" to store the elements.
    The elements have an unpredictable order.
    Very fast: methods add(e), remove(o), and contains(o)
    run in O(1) time! (Assuming that the elements come
    from a class that has a "good" hashCode() method,
    which is the case for Integer, Double, String, and most
    other classes.)

interface SequencedSet<E> extends Set<E>, SequencedCollection<E>
    A SequencedSet is a Set (so no duplicates)
    whose elements have a predictable order.

class LinkedHashSet<E> extends HashSet<E> implements SequencedSet<E>
    The order of the elements is "insertion order."
    It uses a "hash table" along with a linked list to store the elements.
    Still fast: methods add(e), remove(o), and contains(o) still
    run in O(1) time, though a bit slower than HashSet.

interface Map<K, V>
    A mapping (association) from keys to values.
    That is, a collection of entries, where each entry has a key
    and a value.
    A map allows you to search for a value based on a key.
    Duplicate keys are not allowed; duplicate values are.
    Each key maps to exactly one value.
    Does not extend Iterable nor Collection.
    Some methods:
        size()
        isEmpty()
        put(key, value)
        get(key)
        getOrDefault(key, defaultValue)
        remove(key)
        containsKey(o)
        containsValue(o)
        keySet()
        values()
        entrySet()

interface Map.Entry<K, V> (nested in the Map interface)
    Some methods:
        getKey()
        getValue()
        setValue()

class HashMap<K, V> implements Map<K, V>
    The basic implementation of Map.
    When using a HashMap, all Map methods listed above,
    except containsValue, run in O(1) time.
    containsValue runs in O(n) time.
    Iterating over a view of a map (obtained from keySet(), values(), or entrySet())
    takes O(n) time.

interface SequencedMap<K, V> extends Map<K, V>

class LinkedHashMap<K, V> extends HashMap<K, V> implements SequencedMap<K, V>
