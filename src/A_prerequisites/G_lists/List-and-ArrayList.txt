We all know (or should know...) how to use ArrayLists.

You should know that ArrayList<E> is a generic class,
so we specify the desired element type inside angle brackets.
For example, to create an ArrayList of Strings, we say:
  ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
Actually, once we've specified "String" (or whatever type)
on the left-hand side, we don't have to specify it on the
right-hand side, so we can just say:
  ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

You should also know that the element type (which we place
inside the angle brackets) must be a reference type. That is,
it cannot be any of the eight primitive types, such as int,
double, boolean, or char. If we want a list of integers,
for example, we have to use the Integer wrapper type, as in:
  ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

You should already know the following ArrayList<E> methods:
- public int size()
- public boolean isEmpty()
- public boolean add(E e)
- public void add(int index, E element)
- public boolean remove(Object o)
- public E remove(int index)
- public E get(int index)
- public E set(int index, E element)
- public boolean contains(Object o)
- public int indexOf(Object o)

Here are a few things which you might not yet know about ArrayLists.

1. The ArrayList class inherits from the List<E> interface.
   The List interface specifies what it means to be a list.
   Part of being a list means that the elements have indexes.
   The List interface specifies methods such as add(int index, E element),
   remove(int index), get(int index), and indexOf(Object o).
   In the List interface, these methods are abstract.
   There are a few implementations of the List interface,
   one of which is ArrayList. That is, there are a few
   different classes that inherit from the List interface
   and override the inherited abstract methods.
   These classes differ considerably in their internal details,
   but an object of any of these classes is guaranteed to have
   the essential list methods, since these classes inherit from
   the List interface.

2. The List interface, in turn, inherits from the Collection<E>
   interface, which specifies what it means to be a collection,
   that is, a group of objects.
   The Collection interface specifies methods such as
   add(E element), remove(Object o), contains(Object o), and size().
   These methods are abstract in Collection, and they are
   overriden in classes like ArrayList.
   A collection may or may not allow duplicates,
   may or may not have indexes,
   may or may not have a predictable iteration order, etc.
   There are a few kinds of collections; one kind is list.

3. As we know, we are allowed to use a variable of a supertype to
   refer to an object of a subtype. For example, suppose we have the
   following classes:
      class Person {} // implicitly extends Object
      class Student extends Person {}
      class Undergraduate extends Student {}
   Then the following statements are all legal:
      Person p1 = new Person();
      Person p2 = new Student();
      Person p2 = new Undergraduate();

   Since ArrayList inherits from List, which inherits from Collection,
   the following statements are legal:
      List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
      Collection<String> collection = new ArrayList<>();

4. The List interface has a useful static method named "of".
   It has a vararg parameter.
   This method allows you to pass to it any number of items,
   and returns a List that contains all of those items,
   in the order in which they were provided.
   For example:
      List<Integer> list = List.of(7, 3, 5);
      System.out.println(list);        // [7, 3, 5]
      System.out.println(list.size()); // 3

   Importantly, the List returned by the List.of method is unmodifiable.
   This means that elements cannot be added, removed, replaced, or moved around.
   Calling an add, remove, set, or sort method on an unmodifiable List will
   cause an UnsupportedOperationException to be thrown. But you can
   call methods like size and contains.

   Note that List.of is another example of a static factory method.

   List.of is a generic method, so it works with all reference types.

   Challenge: what gets printed here?
        int[] ints = {1, 2, 3};
        System.out.println(List.of(ints).size());
   Answer: 1, not 3!
   Explanation: generics don't play nice with primitive types.
   Since the method can't return List<int>, it returns a List<int[]>.

5. The ArrayList class has a few constructors.
   One constructor, used above, is a no-arg constructor.
   Another constructor has a Collection as its parameter. This constructor
   takes all the elements from the provided collection and adds them
   to the newly-created ArrayList. For example:
      List<Integer> list1 = List.of(1, 2, 3);       // unmodifiable
      List<Integer> list2 = new ArrayList<>(list1); // modifiable
      System.out.println(list2); // prints: [1, 2, 3]
   Note that list1 is a List, which inherits from Collection, so
   it can be passed to ArrayList's constructor.
   This is a great way of creating a standard modifiable list and
   quickly filling it with some elements. That is, instead of the
   following long way:
       List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
       list.add("a");
       list.add("b");
       list.add("c");
   we can instead say, much more concisely:
       List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(List.of("a", "b", "c"));
